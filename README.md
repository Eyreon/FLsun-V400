Everything you need for quality prints

There have been many topics and posts around a few common faults of this machine.
To adress these I would like to add a knowledgebase and get all the printers out there to work as they should.

Some of the common issues out there:
1: The white stuff at the nozzle > This is a silicone pase to keep the sock on the heatblock and nothing to worry about.
2: Nozzle dragging > This is one of the biggest frustrations to users out there and it seems to revolve around proper calibration and software setting.
For the sake of simplicity I will only use CURA (5.1 at this time) as a reference.
3: Top layer quality > this one is a direct connect to #2 and will resolve itself when following my next steps.


Additionally I will add useful links to builds for the printer and advanced user posts.
